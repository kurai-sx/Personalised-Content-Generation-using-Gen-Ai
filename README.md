# Personalised-Content-Generation-using-Gen-Ai
Leverage generative AI to create personalized marketing content for customers, enhancing their engagement and experience with the bank.
Our solution involves developing a Python Flask application that leverages Google Gemini AI to generate personalized captions for marketing content. Users will input the idea for the caption, content type (image, text), and context. The application will process these inputs, use the AI model to create tailored captions, and display the results on the screen. This approach ensures that marketing content is highly personalized, engaging, and relevant to each customer, thereby enhancing their overall experience with the bank.
